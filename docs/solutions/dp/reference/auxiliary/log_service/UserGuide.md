# User Guide on our Log service API

## General information

### About logs
Just about every flow, pipeline and service on the Data Platform has an AWS Log
group. In these, there are log streams that represents the sequence of events
coming from an application instance or a resource on DP. Through these logs we
can  monitor errors, trace back the occurrence of the failure and from there
easily debug.

### On Data Platform
From Monitoring -> Logs Explorer you can freely search through Data Platforms'
various log groups.
