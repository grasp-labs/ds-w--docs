# Data Platform Entitlement Service
The data platform permission system has two key components:

1. Entitlements: Group and service access management.
2. Access Control Lists: Data access management.

Data platform permissions is regulated by the `entitlements` service. Entitlements
allow administrators to define groups and regulate permissions to services.

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are used to define permissions to data. ACL can be defined
and regulated by administrators much the same way as permissions to services.

## Entitlements Service

regulate permissions. In simple terms, entitlements is a service that can be
used to give access to services to a group of users.

## Access Control Lists
