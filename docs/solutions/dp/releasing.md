# 🚪 Release Management Guide for Microservice Architecture

This document outlines how to structure, tag, and promote **pre-releases (alpha, beta, RC)** across a **distributed codebase** with:

- Microservice architecture (micro-arch pattern)
- Multiple repositories and languages (Go, Node, Python, etc.)
- Event-driven architecture via **Kafka**
- Single domain + network model
- React-based frontend (with micro frontends for features)

---

## 📀 Architectural Overview

### Components

| Layer     | Stack                   | Notes                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend  | React, micro-frontends  | Feature-isolated deploys via routing or shell app |
| Backend   | Go, Python, Node        | Each service is versioned independently           |
| Messaging | Kafka                   | Event schemas and compatibility tracked           |
| Infra     | Terraform / Helm / etc. | Deployed with version-bound configs               |

---

## 🔖 Semantic Versioning Strategy

Every deployable component (frontend, service, schema, infra) follows **SemVer**:

```text
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-PRERELEASE
```

| Segment    | Meaning                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| MAJOR      | Breaking API changes or schema events |
| MINOR      | New features, backward compatible     |
| PATCH      | Bug fixes and safe changes            |
| PRERELEASE | `alpha`, `beta`, `rc` tags            |

---

## 🪪 Pre-release Lifecycle

| Stage  | Purpose                            | Tag format       | Stability     |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Alpha  | Internal, unstable, early testing  | `v1.2.0-alpha.1` | 🔴 Low        |
| Beta   | Feature complete, for QA & staging | `v1.2.0-beta.1`  | 🟧 Medium     |
| RC     | Final QA, candidate for stable     | `v1.2.0-rc.1`    | 🟨 High       |
| Stable | Public release or production ready | `v1.2.0`         | 🟩 Production |

---

## 📂 Multi-Repo Coordination

### Tagging Rules

- Each **repository** (service, frontend, shared libs) is tagged independently.
- A **release coordination repo** (e.g. `releases/`) contains:
  - Changelogs
  - Composite release manifests
  - Version matrices (infra ⬌ services ⬌ frontend)

---

## 💠 Tooling

| Tool                          | Purpose                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| GoReleaser                    | Binary builds + tagging (Go services) |
| Semantic Release / Changesets | JS/Node monorepo versioning           |
| GitHub Actions / Workflows    | CI/CD per component                   |
| Git tags                      | Pre-release tracking                  |
| Kafka schema registry         | Event versioning + validation         |
| Helm, Terraform               | Infra release tracking                |

## 🧷 Release Process (per Component)

### 1. Alpha Release

```bash
git commit -am "feat: initial async handler for X"
git tag v1.4.0-alpha.1
git push origin v1.4.0-alpha.1
```

CI/CD will:

- Build + publish tagged artifacts
- Create pre-release on GitHub
- Deploy to internal dev or ephemeral envs

### 2. Beta Release

```bash
git tag v1.4.0-beta.1
git push origin v1.4.0-beta.1
```

CI/CD will:

- Push to **QA/staging**
- Run full integration & regression tests
- Track release in coordination repo

### 3. RC Release

```bash
git tag v1.4.0-rc.1
git push origin v1.4.0-rc.1
```

- Deployed to **production-like** env
- RC validated by release manager or automation
- May be promoted to stable if approved

### 4. Promote to Stable

```bash
git tag v1.4.0
git push origin v1.4.0
```

## 🔄 Kafka Schema Versioning

- Follow **evolution rules** (backward/forward compatible)
- Tag Kafka schemas using `vX.Y.Z` with metadata in Git
- Promote schema versions in sync with service versioning

---

## 🎨 Frontend Pre-Releases

Each **micro-frontend**:

- Uses `Changesets` (or Nx release flow)
- Versioned independently (`feature-profile@v2.3.0-beta.1`)
- Published as NPM packages or lazy-loaded chunks
- Coordinated via shell app version matrix

---

## 📆 Composite Release Tracking (Release Coordination Repo)

Structure:

```plaintext
/releases
  v1.4.0/
    manifest.yaml
    changelog.md
    backend/
      user-service: v1.4.0
      auth-service: v1.3.2
    frontend/
      shell: v1.2.0
      profile-mf: v2.3.0
    schema/
      user.created.v1: stable
```

---

## 📊 Dashboards & Visibility

- GitHub Releases or GitLab Milestones
- Dashboards in Datadog/Grafana for tagged deployments
- Slack notifications on `beta`, `rc`, and stable releases

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- 🔒 Lock all build inputs by tag (infra, events, deps)
- 🧲 Automate QA per pre-release stage (smoke → regression)
- 🧥 Maintain changelogs and commit policies (Conventional Commits)
- 🤝 Tie RC/stable releases to business OKRs or cutoffs
- 📁 Use manifest versioning to trace end-to-end compatibility

## 🚦 Summary Flow

```plaintext
[Alpha] → internal testing
   ↓
[Beta] → QA/staging
   ↓
[RC] → pre-prod, candidate review
   ↓
[Stable] → production
```
